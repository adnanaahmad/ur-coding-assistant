Build an AI Coding Assistant with LLaMA3 and VS Code
Let's build an AI coding assistant with LLaMA3 and integrate it with VS Code.

Step 1: Download LLaMA3 with Ollama
Install Ollama, an open-source tool for running large language models locally.
Use the command line tool to download LLaMA3 (8B parameters): $ ollama pull llama3

Step 2: Add a System Message to LLaMA3
Create a Modelfile with adjustments, e.g., ./Modelfile:

# ./Modelfile
FROM llama3
PARAMETER temperature 0
SYSTEM "You are Python coding assistant. Help me autocomplete my Python code."

Create a new model from this Modelfile: $ ollama create my-python-assistant -f ./Modelfile

Step 3: Download the Continuue VSCode Extension
Continuue is an open-source extension that connects VSCode with LLMs downloaded with Ollama.
Download it from 

Step 4: Connect VSCode with the LLM
In VSCode, go to the bottom and click the + sign to add a new model.
Select Ollama as the provider and Autodetect to populate the model list.

Step 5: Enjoy Tab-Autocomplete Magic
Start coding, and your Python Coding Assistant will generate suggestions, increasing your speed.
Highlight code, press Command + L, and ask questions to your assistant.
